To make things a bit simpler for us, I made a quick list of things that our game will/might need in the future.

To do: (PLEASE EDIT THIS FILE AS TASKS ARE COMPLETED BY TAKING THEM OFF THE LIST)

1.) Scrolling Map (Map moves with main character)
2.) NPCs (If we're having any)
3.) Dialogue boxes for NPC text(?)(Depends on if we're going with a bigger focus on the story, but we'll probably need it in some form anyway)
4.) Physics for objects
5.) Background
6.) Background moves throughout level/With character(?)


-(?) = Unsure if needed-
