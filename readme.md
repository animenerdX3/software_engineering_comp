To run our video game, you must run the .EXE file and press play. Have fun! :) (We currently do not have an .EXE yet and you can't really play the game at all) 

Maybe one day, though. Like, in the future.

Instructions/larger description of game will be placed here, possibly with explanations of features, story, and characters.

Res folder holds the resources of the game
