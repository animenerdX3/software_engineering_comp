Things For Yannick "The Meat Beating Beast" Almeida To Do:
1. When the player moves left, make their animation stay left. This will require a stillImageLeft and stillImageRight animation.
The end goal is so when the player moves left and stops, he is still looking left and vice versa. We need this for projectiles.
2. The flip animation for reverse gravity.
2.5. If you wanna try your hand on something new, try findin a way for us to have a text box in our game, so the user can input their name or something.
With love,
Ya boi
